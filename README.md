### Description

Exploratory data analysis and visualization of Uber Pickup data cross referenced with demographic information about New York City.

### Summary

This project aimed to find the correlations between neighborhood demographics and Uber pickup frequency. We wanted to know if there were certain demographic profiles that could potentially affect pickup frequency. By integrating demographic data for New Yorkâ€™s various neighborhoods, we cross-referenced them with Uber pickup data gathered from January 2015 to June 2015 and displayed the results in various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships. Our results were heavily skewed towards higher population areas such as Downtown Manhattan. That being said, there were interesting but not unexpected relationships between median neighborhood income and the amount of pickups that occur. People with more money tend to get picked up more. While our results do not provide insight into any truly ground breaking results, they set the stage for further research that builds upon the results we gathered.

### Application

While our exact findings do not and should not be the cause for any sweeping policy change from Uber, it does present an interesting methodology for examining behavior trends in Uber pickups. Companies such as Uber and Lyft could use their presumably large wealth of tracking information combined with the markets they operate in and find patterns of where and when their rides are most taken which could influence pricing, surge pricing and timing, marketing, hiring, etc. With recent controversies in ride sharing driver ethics, these companies can try to find causal factors that can better inform their response to these situations when they arise e.g. is surge pricing disproportionately affecting ridership in a community?

Traditional transit companies such as Taxis and mass public transit systems can use similar methodologies to examine their rider profiles and find new opportunities such as competing with Uber and Lyft, expansion projects, renovations, route adjustments, etc.
